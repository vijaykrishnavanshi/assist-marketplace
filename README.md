# Assist Marketplace

This is a two-sided marketplace where domestic helpers can get on-boarded directly or through an agency. On the other hand, the users will be able to find an appropriate helper based on a number of different criterion

## Basic Feature

- [X] Any new member of this application can sign up either as a domestic helper offering their services or as a normal user. You will need to create a complete user login and authentication system

- [ ] A domestic helper will have to go through an on-boarding process which might include things like proving their identity, entering their preferred work areas, their service charges (hourly or weekly or monthly)

- [ ] The normal users will see a list of domestic helpers available in their area and will be able to sort them based on various filters

- [ ] Once the users have selected a helper, they can make them an offer to work 

- [ ] The helpers will get an email notification, and can accept or reject offers. The helpers should be able to choose only one offer for a specified time period. The application should restrict them from double booking

- [ ] Once a helper accepts an offer to work, the user who offered the work should also get an email notification

- [ ] The code should have adequate test coverage

- [ ] The code should have regular and frequent git commits and informative commit messages

## Development

This marketplace has two actors

- User (USER)
- Domestic Helper (HELPER)

Actors have email as their mode of communication.
