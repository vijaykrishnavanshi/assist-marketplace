# Assist Marketplace

This is a two-sided marketplace where domestic helpers can get on-boarded directly or through an agency. On the other hand, the users will be able to find an appropriate helper based on a number of different criterion

## Scope of Assignment

This assignment is tailored towards busy professionals from metro cities who spend more than 10-12 hours a day at their work or regular commute. These professionals presumably donâ€™t have enough time to clean their houses due to their busy schedules and hence would like to avail of a service which can connect them with domestic helpers online. You can choose any frameworks from the following languages - Java, Javascript, Python

## Basic Feature

- [X] Any new member of this application can sign up either as a domestic helper offering their services or as a normal user. You will need to create a complete user login and authentication system

- [X] A domestic helper will have to go through an on-boarding process which might include things like proving their identity, entering their preferred work areas, their service charges (hourly or weekly or monthly)

- [X] Once the users have selected a helper, they can make them an offer to work.

- [X] The helpers will get an email notification, and can accept or reject offers. The helpers should be able to choose only one offer for a specified time period. The application should restrict them from double booking
